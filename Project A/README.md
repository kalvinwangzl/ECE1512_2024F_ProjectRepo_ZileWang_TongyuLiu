# Project A: Dataset Distillation
The project consists of two major parts: Task 1 and Task 2. 

## Task 1
In Task 1 we need to use the code in [naive](./naive) and [DataDAM](./DataDAM)

Code in [naive](./naive) are for training the models on original datasets by running [train_MNIST_or_CIFAR.py](./naive/train_MNIST_or_CIFAR.py) and [train_MHIST.py](./naive/train_MHIST.py)

Code in [DataDAM](./DataDAM) are for training the models using DataDAM methods that generates the distillated images, which can be achieved by running [main_DataDAM.py](./DataDAM/main_DataDAM.py)

In Task 2 we need to use the code in [DeepCore](./DeepCore), [PAD](./PAD) and [EDC](./EDC)
